# Skill Structure Patterns

Choose a structure that fits your skill's purpose. Patterns can be mixed and matched.

## 1. Workflow-Based (sequential processes)

Best when there are clear step-by-step procedures.

```
## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...
```

**Example**: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"

## 2. Task-Based (tool collections)

Best when the skill offers different operations/capabilities.

```
## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...
```

**Example**: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"

## 3. Reference/Guidelines (standards or specifications)

Best for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements.

```
## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...
```

**Example**: Brand styling with "Colors" → "Typography" → "Logo Usage"

## 4. Capabilities-Based (integrated systems)

Best when the skill provides multiple interrelated features.

```
## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...
```

**Example**: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list

## Choosing a Pattern

| Skill type | Recommended pattern |
|---|---|
| File format processing (PDF, DOCX) | Workflow-based or Task-based |
| Brand/style guidelines | Reference/Guidelines |
| API integrations | Task-based |
| Complex domain (PM, finance) | Capabilities-based |
| Simple utility | Task-based (minimal) |

Most skills combine patterns — start with one and add others as complexity warrants.
